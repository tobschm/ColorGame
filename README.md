# About
This is a game using the Stroop-effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect), as I have first seen it in the Nintendo DS Game "Dr. Kawashimas Brain Training" many years ago. The game works as follows: A random color name is displayed. Instead of reading the colorname, the user has to say the text color as fast as possible to proceed to the next round.

# Technical description
This application is created with React and Javascript. Speech recognition is used to gather the users input and check for the color-name.
